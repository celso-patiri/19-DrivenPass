## Summary

  - The purpose of the app is to store sensitive data, like online account credentials, secure notes, document numbers, etc
  - The data is server-side encrypted and decrypted via the API
  - The supported item models are:
    - `Credentials` - username, password and url for a website
    - `Notes` - simple encrypted text notes
    - `Cards` - credit or debit card information
    - `Wifi` - wifi network name and password
    - `Documents` - personal document numbers

## What I Learned
  
  - The fundamentals of Vue 3
  - Composition API, setup function, refs and reactivity, events
  - Slots and templates, provide/inject, suspense API, dynamic routing

  - More Prisma [data modeling features](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model)
  - Issues of response and error handling consistency when scaling an API ðŸ¥²

## :rocket: Routes

- The default responses are:

  - `204` - Successful DELETE request
  - `401` - Auth errors
  - `404` - Resource not found
